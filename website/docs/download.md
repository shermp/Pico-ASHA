# Downloads

You can download the firmware and GUI application from the following links:

[Pico W Firmware](https://github.com/shermp/Pico-ASHA/releases/download/v0.2.0/pico_asha_v0.2.0_firmware_pico_w.uf2)

[Pico 2W Firmware](https://github.com/shermp/Pico-ASHA/releases/download/v0.2.0/pico_asha_v0.2.0_firmware_pico_2w.uf2)

[Pico ASHA Gui for Windows](https://github.com/shermp/Pico-ASHA/releases/download/v0.2.0/pico-asha-v0.2.0-gui-win64.zip)

!!! Note

    Pico ASHA Gui is only compiled for Windows at this time. Linux users 
    can compile it themselves if required. I do not have a Mac to build or test.

    I accept [pull requests](https://github.com/shermp/Pico-ASHA/pulls) to add precompiled binaries for other OS's.
