# FAQ

### Does Pico ASHA work with my hearing device?

Pico ASHA has been developed using a pair of Oticon More hearing aids.
Oticon hearing aids from the More and later series should work fine.

Please open an [issue](https://github.com/shermp/Pico-ASHA/issues) if 
your hearing aid fails to work, and I might be able to get it working.

!!! Warning
    
    Starkey Arc AI is known to not work at this time. Other Starkey devices
    may also fail to work.

### Can I use Pico ASHA and my Android phone at the same time?

Probably not. You will most likely need to disconnect your hearing devices
and/or disable bluetooth on your phone before using Pico ASHA.

### Should I use this?

It depends.

If you have a recent hearing device which supports LE Audio, you may prefer 
to use the LE Audio support included in Windows or Linux, or a LE Audio adapter.

Some hearing devices can now use MFi on Mac computers.

ASHA support has recently been added to Linux, and may be available on 
distributions such as Fedora or Arch. This may be a better option.
